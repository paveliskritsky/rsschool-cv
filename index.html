                I have experience in the field of security.(Access Control System,Fire alarm,security alarm). I have been working in this field for about 2 years.
                No web development experience. I want to try myself in this area. I'm very interested to figure out how all this works. 
                I took a few courses at HTML Academy. I understand that my knowledge is superficial. I will do my best to become better in this area. 
                I studied as a programmer engineer in Belarusian State Technological University. After passing the first session, I took the documents. Studied C ++.
